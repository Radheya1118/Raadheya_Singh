Hello!  If you have a wonderful game concept, I'd be delighted to assist you in realizing your ambition.  I'm a Unity game designer and developer with a lot of expertise. I've released a number of 3D games for mobile, PC, and Oculus.    My procedure is as follows:    First, make a game design document.  2. Develop fundamental game mechanics  3. collect supplies and resources (3D models, graphics, animations, etc)    merging assets into game mechanics (stage 2)  5. incorporating game features (Ads, IAP, Leaderboards, achievements, etc)  6. Increasing the focus on game mechanics.  7. Perform tests on target platforms (Android, iOS, PC, Oculus)    stage 3: 8. Fine-tuning the gameplay experience  9. Asset creation for store posting (Screenshots, videos, icon, etc)  10. Publication.    From the beginning, making a game will be an experience.    Before placing a purchase, please contact me!
